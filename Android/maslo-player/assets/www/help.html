<a name="get"><h3>Getting Content Packs</h3></a>

To view and obtain new content packs, you will need a network connection. Both Wi-Fi and data networks (such as 3G) work. 
Once you are online tap on the "Shop" button. You will see a list of all available content packs, including the ones 
already installed on your device. If you have already installed packs, or if your app comes with pre-installed packs, 
you will see an "Installed" button to the right of any packs on your device. You will not be able to install those 
packs again unless you delete them first.<br/>
Content packs not already installed will have an "Install" button on their right, and tapping that button will guide you 
through an installation dialog. You will receive a message when the pack installation is completed and will be able 
to enter the newly installed content pack right away. In case a content pack you already installed has been updated 
since you last visited the store, the pack will display an "Update" button to the right. Like the "Install" button, 
tapping the "Update" button will guide you through the update process. <p/>

<a name="delete"><h3>Deleting Content Packs</h3></a>

To delete a content pack, you need to be on the "Home" screen. There you
can see a list of all installed content packs. To sort your packs alphabetically, tap on the "Sort" button in the upper 
left corner of the screen. Tap again to sort in descending order.
In the upper right corner of the screen you find an "Edit" button. Tap the "Edit" button and red and white delete icons 
will show up next to each content pack. Tap on the icon next to the content pack you want to delete. This will cause a 
"Delete" button to appear to the right of the selected content pack name. Tap "Delete" and you will be guided through the 
pack deletion. <p/>

<a name="navigate"><h3 name="navigate">Navigating Content Packs</h3></a>

You can enter a content pack from either "Home" or "Shop" by tapping on the pack name. This will bring you to the pack's 
table of contents where you will see a list of all the sections in a pack. Tapping on one of the sections will open 
that section. To navigate forward or backward, you can either swipe left or right on your device or use the left/
right buttons in the header. The "Back" button will bring you back to the content pack's table of content.<br/>
In addition to text items, packs can contain a variety of media. In the case of images, you can click on the displayed 
image to enlarge it. Clicking on the enlarged image will close it again. Audio and 
video content is opened in a new device-specific video player window. Leaving the video player or completing 
the video brings you back to the video content start screen.<br/>
If there is a quiz item in a pack, once you have opened the first question in the quiz, swipe will be deactivated. 
Although  you can leave a quiz by using any of the navigation buttons, once you submit an answer for a quiz item, you 
cannot revise any earlier answers. Using the top bar navigation arrow buttons will bring you to the next/previous
section of the current content pack. "Back" will open the current content pack's overview.
