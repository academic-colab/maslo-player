<a name="get"><h3>Getting Content Packs</h3></a>

To view and obtain new content packs, you will need a network connection. Both Wi-Fi and data networks (such as 3G) work. 
Once you are online tap on the "Shop" button. You will see a list of all available content packs including the ones 
already installed on your device. If you have already installed packs - or if your app comes with pre-installed packs - 
you will see an "Installed" button to the right of some of the packs on your device. These packs are available for viewing.
If you want to re-install them you will need to <a href="#delete">delete them</a> first.
<p/>Content packs not already installed will have an "Install" button on their right, and tapping that button will guide you 
through an installation dialogue. You will receive a message when the pack installation is completed and will be able 
to view the newly installed content pack right away.
<p/>In case a content pack you already installed has been updated since you last visited the store, the pack will display an
"Update" button to the right. Like the "Install" button, tapping the "Update" button will guide you through the update process.

<a name="viewing"><h3>Viewing Content Packs</h3></a>

You can enter a content pack from either "Home" or "Shop" by tapping on the pack name. This will bring you to the pack's 
table of contents where you will see a list of all the sections in a pack.  From the "Home" screen you can also sort your packs
alphabetically. Tap on the "Sort" button in the upper left corner of the screen. Tap again to sort in descending order.

Once inside a pack you will see a table of contents.  tapping on one of the sections will open that section. To navigate
forward or backward, you can either swipe left or right on your
device or use the left/right buttons in the header. The "Back" button will bring you back to the content pack's table of contents.
<p/>In addition to text items, packs can contain a variety of media: 
<h5>Images</h5>
<p/>You can tap on the displayed image to enlarge it. Tapping on the enlarged image again will close it.

<h5>Audio</h5>
<p/>On iOS audio content can be played back inline by tapping on the "play" button. During playback you can pause the audio at any time
by tapping the "pause" button. You can also use the scroll bar to navigate within the audio file. 
<p/>On Android audio content is opened in a new video player window.  Leaving the video player or completing the content brings you back
to the audio content start screen.

<h5>Video</h5>
<p/>Video content is opened in a new device-specific video player window. Leaving the video player or completing 
the video brings you back to the video content start screen.<br/>

<h5>Quizzes</h5>
<p/>Once you have opened the first question in the quiz, swipe will be deactivated. 
Although you can leave a quiz by using any of the navigation buttons, once you submit an answer for a quiz item, you 
cannot revise any earlier answers. Using the top bar navigation arrow buttons will bring you to the next/previous
section of the current content pack.
